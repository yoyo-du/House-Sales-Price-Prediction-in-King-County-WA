**STA 525 Programming and Data Management in SAS**

This project utilized multiple linear regression with the lasso shrinkage to predict the house sales price based on a data set including the house sold information of King County, WA. The final model is the model with the smallest predicted residual sum of square summed across 10 cross-validation folds in the training set. The prediction accuracy of the model on both the training and test sets is high. Based on our analyses, the grade, square footage of the living space, and the latitude are the three most important factors in prediction house sales prices.
